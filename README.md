# 🐍 Python Daily Practice

This repository contains my **daily Python practice** for Codewars challenges.  
The aim is to sharpen logical thinking, improve code readability, and develop algorithmic efficiency — one kata at a time.

## 🎯 My Goals
I have to get at least 5 kyu for better logical thinking in python with clear, readable, and efficient code.
